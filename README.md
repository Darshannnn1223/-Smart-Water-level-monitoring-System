ðŸ“Œ Project: Automatic Water Level Controller with Pump & Alert System

This project is an Arduino-based water level monitoring and control system that automatically manages a water pump based on the tankâ€™s water level. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water level distance, and provides real-time status updates on an I2C LCD display.

ðŸ”§ Features:

Ultrasonic Sensor â€“ Measures the water level distance in cm.

LED Indicators â€“

Red LED â†’ Tank Empty

Yellow LED â†’ Medium Level

Green LED â†’ Tank Full

Buzzer Alert â€“ Sounds when the tank is full.

Motor Pump Control â€“

Turns ON when the tank is empty or medium level.

Turns OFF when the tank is full.

I2C LCD Display â€“ Shows real-time distance and tank status.

âš¡ Hardware Used:

Arduino Uno

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

I2C LCD (16x2)

LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)

Buzzer

Motor Driver (L293D or L298N)

Water Pump

ðŸ’» Software:

Arduino IDE

LiquidCrystal_I2C Library

Wire Library

ðŸš€ Working Principle:

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance of water from the sensor.

Based on the distance:

If >10 cm â†’ Tank Empty â†’ Pump ON

If 3â€“10 cm â†’ Tank Medium â†’ Pump stays ON

If â‰¤2 cm â†’ Tank Full â†’ Pump OFF + Buzzer ON

The LCD displays both distance in cm and tank status.
